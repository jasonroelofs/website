That's right, I decided on a name. Being a huge fan of Douglas Adams, and especially the <em>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>, it seemed only right to pay homage to such a great author and fantastically weird story. 

So the choice of theme made, the name came down to two: Forty-Two, otherwise known as The Answer, or Slartibartfast, because the name really doesn't matter. I was leaning towards Forty-Two, and with an extra vote from a good friend of mine, it became the name.

I'll probably update other parts of the site to fit the theme, like the subtitle and the categories. All in all, feels good to have a solidly named site.

Now, what <b>do</b> you get when you multiply six by nine?
