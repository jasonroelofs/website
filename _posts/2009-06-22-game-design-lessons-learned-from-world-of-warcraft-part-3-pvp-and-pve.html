So I'll be honest. I've had a huge rant building up for some time now on how Blizzard has royally screwed up WoW, and continues to do so, because they have a flawed look at how to balance PvP and PvE gameplay together.
</p>

<p>
I'm not going to write it because frankly, I'd never want to read it. So I've condensed my point into three simple words:
</p>

<h3><em>BALANCE</em></h3>

<h3><em>PVP</em></h3>

<h3><em>FIRST</em></h3>

<p>
You simply cannot have a PvE game and add PvP on top of it. PvP is player skill, PvE is just numbers. One could go to the extreme and say that they can't co-exist, but I'm not quite convinced this is true. Close, but not quite.
