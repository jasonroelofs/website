My name is Jason Roelofs, and this is my blog.

I'm a 20-something software developer currently living in Michigan, working for the startup <a href="http://www.bloomfire.com">Bloomfire</a> where I am mainly a Rails and Ruby developer.

I like to dabble in various Open Source projects, and am running a few of my own.

You can <a href="http://github.com/jameskilton">Follow me on GitHub</a> to see what I've been working on recently.
