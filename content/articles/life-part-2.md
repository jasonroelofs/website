> Thou shalt not kill.
> - [Exodus 20:13 (King James Version)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2020:13&version=KJ21)

In [Life, Part 1]({{< relref "articles/life-part-1" >}}) I focused on the beginning of life, the Christian view of life, and the immensely complex and difficult topic of abortion. The topic to be covered in this article is no less complex or divisive. It's time to switch to the opposite end of the spectrum: taking life and specifically, guns.

Americans have a morbid obsession with guns, much more so than pretty much any other country in the world. This obsession is regularly boosted and fueled by groups like the <abbr title="National Rifle Association">NRA</abbr>, who fund and support many politicians and leaders, as well as a fundamental distrust that many Americans have about their own government. Americans also collectively own and possess a lot of guns. It should then come as no surprise that America is also a statistical outlier when it comes to [gun violence per 100,000 citizens](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/08/05/743579605/how-the-u-s-compares-to-other-countries-in-deaths-from-gun-violence) (more guns means more situations where guns exist which means more situations where guns get used).

Many would claim that there's nothing wrong with this picture, that owning guns is our "God-given right" or at least a right given to us by the 2nd Amendment of our Constitution:

> A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

Courts have debated whether this amendment stands for the collective ownership (e.g. a local militia or guard) of guns or for individual ownership, with significant inclination towards individual ownership over the last few decades. But I'm not here to discuss the political and legal aspects of gun ownership, as that is a quagmire I'm not interested in partaking or capable of navigating.

I'm here to talk about the Christian view of guns and gun ownership.

Lets start at the beginning. First, what is a gun? The most neutral explanation I've found basically says that it's a weapon that that accelerates a projectile at high speed, usually through gas expansion (e.g. an explosion). Now using the word "weapon" does imply that a gun is designed to inflict bodily harm or damage, though some insist that a gun is simply a tool, like a knife or a car (which also kill people). However this line of thinking is wishful at best. What we know as a gun was invented by the Chinese as a way to [launch spears at opposing armies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun#History) and since then has had many improvements towards reliability, range, projectile types, etc, all of which serve to make the weapon more capable at its job.

I prefixed this article with the sixth commandment: "Thou shalt not kill" or in other translations "You shall not murder." Unfortunately, as with the rest of this series of articles, life is complicated. If it was as easy as "don't kill people", I wouldn't have much to talk about. As Americans we get to read about regular shootings immediately followed by calls that we need *more* guns. We are so willing and eager to forget that the entire world lived in this mentality during the Cold War, where the stakes were as high as they could get. This mentality of "mutually assured destruction" is not one *anyone* should want! And yet, many who consider themselves conservative, Republican, and most importantly, Christian continue to push this narrative after every shooting event this country suffers. I'll talk more about this in a future article but this is the kind of mentality that pushes people away from Christ. Who would want to be part of a group that's so blatantly hypocritical?

We can't even stop there though. As I said, life is complicated, but to continue this discussion I need to list out the two fundamental truths in our world and the Christian world-view:

1. Guns exist
2. We are all [fallen and sinful]({{< relref "articles/evil-and-sin" >}})

Neither of these truths are changeable in our universe, and the two combined make an exceedingly dangerous combination. Because guns exist, anyone with guns will very quickly subdue anyone without them in a purely physical confrontation. This has naturally lead to extensive research and development of more efficient and deadly weapons across history and around the globe. But even outside of ranged weaponry, humans have been killing each other for our entire known history. There are also plenty of wars mentioned in the Bible, even some sanctioned by God both for and against the Israelites. As such, I would argue that voluntarily throwing down our weapons and disbanding our armed forces would be grossly irresponsible of us (individual gun ownership, though, is a vastly different discussion). We would lose all ability to protect and serve those who need it the most, and while Jesus does command us to "turn the other cheek" (which has interesting connotations when read within the context of how Romans treated people they deemed lesser than themselves) I feel that there is a Christian calling to be a physical bastion protecting others from evil forces.

I'd like to close this by saying that I am not personally completely against guns, and I do have respect for our military, particularly because I grew up in the Air Force where my Dad flew the F-15 Eagle and retired as a Colonel. I also get to regularly partake in another aspect of gun ownership: hunting. My Father-in-Law is an avid hunter who butchers and cooks up the deer that he kills. I believe this kind of hunting, and this use of guns, is sanctioned by God as responsible usage of the many resources this planet has to offer us. But I feel the need to be clear, this is not "gun as a tool", this is still killing, albeit taking the life of an animal instead of another human.

But I do not own a gun, nor do I plan on ever owning one, because of the simple truth that once one has a tool, one is always looking for situations to use said tool. As a Christian, the very thought of taking someone else's life is abhorrent, even if at times it may be necessary, and if you're carrying a gun, then you're always, if subconsciously, looking for a reason to use it (a poignant example: if George Zimmerman wasn't carrying a gun, Trayvon Martin would probably still be alive today). And that is not something I can justify with my faith.
