> Thou shalt not kill.
> - [Exodus 20:13 (King James Version)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2020:13&version=KJ21)

In [Life, Part 1]({{< relref "articles/life-part-1" >}}) I focused on the beginning of life, the Christian view of life, and the immensely complex and difficult topic of abortion. The topic to be covered in this article is no less complex or divisive. It's time to switch to the opposite end of the spectrum, taking life, and guns.

Americans have a morbid obsession with guns, much more so than pretty much any other country in the world. This obsession is regularly boosted and fueled by groups like the NRA, who fund and support many politicians and leaders, as well as a fundamental distrust that many Americans have about their own government. Americans collectively own and possess a lot of guns. It should then come as no surprise that America is also a statistical outlier when it comes to [gun violence per 100,000 citizens](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/08/05/743579605/how-the-u-s-compares-to-other-countries-in-deaths-from-gun-violence) (more guns means more situations where guns exist which means more situations where guns get used).

Many would claim that there's nothing wrong with this picture, that owning guns is our "God-given right" or at least a right given to us by the 2nd Amendment of our Constitution:

> A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

Courts have debated whether this amendment is for the collective ownership (e.g. a local militia or guard) or for individual ownership, with the push towards individual ownership gaining significant traction in the last few decades much through the efforts of the NRA. But I'm not here to discuss the political and legal aspects of gun ownership, as that is a quagmire I'm not interested in partaking or capable of navigating.

I'm here to talk about the Christian view of guns and gun ownership.

Lets start at the beginning. First, what is a gun? The most neutral explanation I've found basically says that it's a weapon that that accelerates a projectile at high speed, usually through gas expansion (e.g. an explosion). Now using the word "weapon" does imply that a gun is designed to inflict bodily harm or damage, though some insist that a gun is simply a tool, like a knife or a car (which also kill people). However this line of thinking is wishful at best. Guns were invented by the Chinese as a way to launch spears at opposing armies and since then has had many improvements towards reliability, range, projectile types, etc, all of which serve to make the weapon more capable at its job. Cars were and are not designed to kill people, that's an unfortunate side effect of operating and living with them.

I prefixed this article with the sixth commandment: "Thou shalt not kill" or in other translations "You shall not murder." Unfortunately, as with the rest of this series of articles, life is complicated. If it was as easy as "don't kill people", I wouldn't have much to talk about. As Americans we get to read about regular shootings immediately followed by calls that we need *more* guns, and that gun ownership is the solution to our problems, from people who are often conservative and/or Republican and who also have a high tendency to consider themselves Christian or otherwise religious. But there are two fundamental truths in our world and the Christian world-view:

1. Guns exist
2. We are all [fallen and sinful]({{< relref "articles/evil-and-sin" >}})

Neither of these points are fixable in our universe, and the two combined make an exceedingly dangerous combination. Because guns exist, any army with guns will very quickly subdue any army without them, naturally leading to extensive research and development of more deadly versions across history and the globe. And outside of ranged weaponry, humans have been killing each other for our entire known history. There are also plenty of wars mentioned in the Bible, even sanctioned by God both for and against the Israelites. As such, I would argue that voluntarily throwing down our weapons and disbanding our armed forces would be grossly irresponsible of us. We would lose all ability to protect and serve those who need it the most, and while Jesus does command us to "turn the other cheek" (which has interesting connotations when read with the context of how Romans treated people they deemed lesser than themselves) I feel that there is a Christian calling to be a physical bastion protecting others from evil forces.
