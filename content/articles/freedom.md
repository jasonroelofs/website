"Freedom" may be the most misunderstood concept of the 21st century. The calls and crys of "freedom of speech" and "I'm free to do what I want" has only increased over the last two decades, finally culimating, as many things did, during the COVID-19 pandemic. But what these people are asking for, crying for, demanding even, isn't freedom. Similarly, "freedom of speech" is not the ability to say whatever, to whomever, whenever you want. We don't have a "freedom to congregate" or a "freedom to run the economy" either.

You are **free** to do any of these things, and plenty more, and you are also free to suffer the consequences of your actions. But that's just a fact of life and has nothing to do with "freedom," the societal and political statement we've been glibly throwing around.

So what, actually, is "freedom"? Well, it's complicated, and in some ways also contradictory. It's also fundamental to understanding not only the founding and history of the United States of America, but it is also the foundation of Christianity itself. Given this complexity, I feel it's best to start with explaining what freedom isn't.

The 21st century, at least as I've experienced it, has seen an increasing call and spread of thought that "freedom" means that I can do what I want, and there are no consequences. Unfortunately this has proven to be a self-fulfilling prophesy in many ways as the Internet, and particular social networks like Twitter and Facebook, has allowed billions of people to show us all the absolute worst humanity has to offer, with very few consequences, at least for those on the attack. This has also been increasingly true of the American political spectrum, where lies abound, attacks happen (verbal and physical) on a regular basis and hate groups are empowered to publicly expouse their ideals.

This isn't freedom. The societal state where everyone one does what they will with no restraint has an explicit term: anarchy. Whether they know it or not, the "freedom" being called for is nothing but a step towards complete societal collapse. This is sadly ironic because a funny thing happens in an anarchy: no-one has any freedoms. When a society no longer agrees on a common set of laws and statues, people form factions and groups both to take what they need, but also to defend themselves against other groups trying to do the same thing. These people are no longer allowed to act freely but are in fact controlled by the very groups they are defending themselves against. English has another explicit term that exactly describes the situation where one has no freedoms but is controlled by another: slavery. Anarchy is slavery, where each person and each group of people are enslaved to each other. In calling for "freedom" these people are in fact demanding the opposite.

You don't need to end up in an anarchy to experience this same kind of slavery though. Many people are enslaved right now, though today we use a less inflamatory word: addiction. Whether it's a chemical addition, such as drugs or alcohol, a psychological addiction to an activity (say, sex), or any myriad of ways we can get "stuck in a rut", being addicted is a form of slavery. The person does not have the freedom to live their life as they want, the addiction always gets a say. On top of this, addiction never affects just the one person. Family, friends, co-workers, and other acquaintences all often have to deal with the pain and the difficulty of the addiction as well. The sad reality is, one person's "freedom" to use drugs or to chase the next adrenaline rush means that many others have also lost their freedom, people who didn't have any choice or say in the matter.

Christianity, then, shows us the honest, ugly truth about freedom and slavery: [sin]({{< relref "articles/evil-and-sin" >}}). We can look at a someone suffering through an addiction and see the consequences, but the real danger is the slavery we all deal with never see. Every white lie. Every hateful thought. Every covetous or lustful glance. Every prideful remark. Every demeaning word. Every tweet thrown off in disgust without thought of the person on the other end. The list goes on and on. Sin is a slave master, and it is insidious. The little things that feel good now and have seemingly no real consequence quickly morph into uncontrollable monsters. We are all sinful, and this is a fight every one of us fights, or doesn't, on a daily basis, and without help we would all be slaves to sin.

But we have that help! God wasn't content to watch us wallow in our disobedience, becoming slaves to our sinful nature, and eventually succumbing to death and eternal damnation. He sent His Son, Jesus, to take our place, to suffer the damnation of sin for us, breaking the chains that bind us to our nature.

Or to put it in another way, Jesus Christ gave up *his own freedom* so that we may be free. But that doesn't absolve us from sin in this life. While those chains cannot drag us into Hell anymore, they are still powerful and we all still fight daily against them. But through Jesus's sacrifice, we are ourselves free to choose a life away from sin.
