"Freedom" may be the most misunderstood concept of the 21st century. The calls and cries of "freedom of speech" and "I'm free to do what I want" now pervade American social and political discourse. It seems that we can't discuss any societal ills without personal "freedom" being thrown into the mix, as if that somehow is the answer to everything. With COVID-19 raging across the country, this seems to be the *only* argument many people care to make. It's all "freedom, freedom, freedom!" (and it's all white people but that's a topic for another day), but what these people are asking for, crying for, demanding even, isn't freedom at all! If these people actually got what they want, they'd find themselves with far no freedom at all. We seem to have lost all concept of "freedom" and now conflate it with the innate ability to act and speak.

"I'm free to do what I want" is a true statement, but it is not freedom. We are all human, we can all talk, we can all act in society, there is nothing that physically restrains us from saying or doing things. We are also free to suffer the consequences of our actions. If you curse at someone, don't be surprised if that person is less interested in talking to you, or curses you back. If you punch someone, don't be surprised if you get punched back. If you party with hundreds of others during a pandemic, you shouldn't be surprised when you [end up positive for COVID-19](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/07/10/several-test-positive-virus-after-torch-lake-july-4-celebration/5418980002/). But this truth is lost on many today, for many reasons that I'll get into in another article. But before that will make sense, we need to understand what "freedom" actually is.

To put it more directly, "freedom" is not a complete lack of restrictions, regulations, or consequences on words and actions. First of all, that's not how life works. We all control and watch our words and actions around friends, family, co-workers, etc, often subconsciously, using internal rubrics we build up over a life time of interactions with others. Such self-restriction enables and sustains relationships of all kinds, especially in the face of disagreement, issues, or arguments. We, for the most part, successfully co-exist with each other because we have empathy with our friends and family and are aware of how our actions can hurt them.

Such control and self-regulation, though, is not easy, as anyone reading this (myself included) can immediately remember many situations where a slip of the tongue ended up hurting a close friend or relative. This gets even harder when interacting with people we've never talked to before, and what we've seen in this country as of late is a complete disregard for all social norms when dealing with "the other side." We know now that wearing a mask is the most effective way to control the spread of COVID-19 it requires all of us to wear them for it to be effective. "But requiring me to wear a mask impinges on my freedoms!" goes the heavily-armed, white, angry crowd. Well, because wearing a mask is intended to prevent infected people from spreading the disease to others, when these people refuse to wear a mask, *they are impinging on the freedoms of the rest of us!*

And that's why we as a society don't understand "freedom" anymore, because true freedom *requires* empathy and a willingness to put the well being of others before yourself. In a society that cares only for individuals and selfish ambition, freedom dies, because those selfish ambitions will, by definition, get in the way of someone else's desire to life their life as they want. There is no greater example in this country than the Black Lives Matter movement. Black people have never had the freedoms that this country espouses and because of this the only logical conclusion is that America itself has never had true freedom. It's true that freedom is incredibly hard to achieve, but this country is currently running away from it as fast as it can, and if we continue down this path, we all lose.





The freedom to live our life, to make our own way in the world, is only possible if everyone respects each other's freedom, a stance that often requires sacrifice, someone giving up their freedom so someone else doesn't have their freedom forcibly taken away. Freedom isn't free. In fact, freedom is incredibly hard to keep. It requires a loving, caring, sacrificial, *and forgiving* mindset towards life and others, because we will fail at this and fail often and freedom can only continue to exist when we are able to not only hold people accountable but to forgive each other when mistakes are made.

You may have noticed that this article is included in the [Christianity]({{< relref "series/christianity" >}}) series and that's because freedom, true freedom, is the most fundamental building block on top of which the entire religion is built. God created humans and gave us free will, but the only way one can have free will is if there is the possibility of disobedience, which we subsequently did (see ["Evil and Sin"]({{< relref "articles/evil-and-sin" >}})). We had freedom to do anything we wanted within a very simple set of rules (don't eat from this tree), and by breaking that rule we lost everything and began the downward spiral that led to us becoming enslaved in sin. It wasn't possible for us to not sin anymore. Disobedience was the rule, not the exception, and any concept of freedom was gone.

But God who loved his creation with a love that we can't even begin to comprehend, sacrificed himself through Jesus dying on the cross in order to forgive us of our disobedience. With that one single act, God freed us from our slavery to sin, granting us true freedom.
