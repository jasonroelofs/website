"Freedom" may be the most misunderstood concept of the 21st century. The calls and cries of "freedom of speech" and "I'm free to do what I want" now pervade American social and political discourse. It seems that we can't discuss any societal ills without personal freedom being thrown into the mix, as if that somehow is the answer to everything. When COVID-19 hit, things only got worse, including armed protests because people couldn't go to the hairdresser and didn't want to wear masks. It's all "freedom, freedom, freedom!" (and it's all white people but that's a topic for another day), but what these people are asking for, crying for, demanding even, isn't freedom at all! If these people actually got what they want, they'd find themselves with far fewer freedoms than they started out with. How is such a contradiction possible? It's only a contradiction when we don't understand what freedom really entails, and true freedom far more complex than "I can do/say what I want".

Let's get the simplest aspects of freedom out of the way first. Yes, we are "free to say or do what we want", but that comes with a caveat that few people talk about today: we are also free to suffer the consequences of our words and actions. While our current political climate has unfortunately been steeped in failing to hold important holding people accountable for their actions, day-to-day life is full of situations where actions have serious and real ramifications. A major part of life is navigating the waters of inter-personal communication, figuring out what is and isn't ok to say or do. We are free to do whatever we want, but we regularly find ourselves in situations where what we want to do would hurt someone else, so we don't do it, or we find a way to benefit both parties. These compromises happen every day, often without us realizing what is going on. This is freedom, but the true definition is still a bit murky.

We can help clarify our understanding of freedom by approaching it from another direction: what freedom *isn't.* Freedom is not the complete lack of restrictions or regulations on what someone can or cannot do. The lack of laws and accountability to those laws (whether political, societal, religious, or personal) has a different name: anarchy. When there is no accountability at all, society collapses into an every-person-for-themselves hell. However this complete free-for-all rarely lasts long, because a funny thing always happens when humans find themselves in such situations. We are social creatures at our core and as such isolation is abhorrent to us. When we find ourselves isolated and alone, we yearn and search for like-minded people, and in finding them create groups of mutual protection and support. When too many people end up in such groups, life turns into an Us vs Them society, where groups are looking out only for the good of their own members, and if one group has something another group wants, it can get ugly quickly.

Some would argue that these groups have freedom, they are free from external control and restrictions, but that couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, each and every group in such a society are in fact enslaved to each other. How is this the case? Because in a situation where anyone is free to attack you, steal from you, or otherwise negatively affect you, you are now forced to defend yourself against such incursions. Thus, there is no freedom. Your actions are now completely and utterly controlled by the other groups' wants and needs. No-one has freedom of any sort. Or to put it succinctly: anarchy is a form of slavery.

So, where there are no rules, or when people insist on every-person-for-themselves, society devolves into anarchy and slavery, which is definitely *not* freedom. That's how "I can do what I want" leads to the exact opposite of freedom. But, what *is* freedom? Well, how does one transition out of anarchy? Anarchy only ends when the competing groups realize that the only way to move forward is to accept each other's differences and to work together for the good of everyone. And how does that work? By coming to a collective agreement of which rules everyone agrees to follow *and* agrees to hold each other accountable in following said rules.

And therein lies the contradiction and the fundamental truth of freedom: freedom can *only* exist when members of society are looking out for each other, and not just for themselves, because the *only* way freedom can exist is if no-one is impinging upon the freedom another.

The freedom to live our life, to make our own way in the world, is only possible if everyone respects each other's freedom, a stance that often requires sacrifice, someone giving up their freedom so someone else doesn't have their freedom forcibly taken away. Freedom isn't free. In fact, freedom is incredibly hard to keep. It requires a loving, caring, sacrificial, *and forgiving* mindset towards life and others, because we will fail at this and fail often and freedom can only continue to exist when we are able to not only hold people accountable but to forgive each other when mistakes are made.

You may have noticed that this article is included in the [Christianity]({{< relref "series/christianity" >}}) series and that's because freedom, true freedom, is the most fundamental building block on top of which the entire religion is built. God created humans and gave us free will, but the only way one can have free will is if there is the possibility of disobedience, which we subsequently did (see ["Evil and Sin"]({{< relref "articles/evil-and-sin" >}})). We had freedom to do anything we wanted within a very simple set of rules (don't eat from this tree), and by breaking that rule we lost everything and began the downward spiral that led to us becoming enslaved in sin. It wasn't possible for us to not sin anymore. Disobedience was the rule, not the exception, and any concept of freedom was gone.

But God who loved his creation with a love that we can't even begin to comprehend, sacrificed himself through Jesus dying on the cross in order to forgive us of our disobedience. With that one single act, God freed us from our slavery to sin, granting us true freedom.
