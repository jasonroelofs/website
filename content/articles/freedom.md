"Freedom" may be the most misunderstood concept of the 21st century. The calls and cries of "freedom of speech" and "I'm free to do what I want" now pervade American social and political discourse. It seems that we can't discuss any societal ills without personal "freedom" being thrown into the mix, as if that somehow is the answer to everything. With COVID-19 raging across the country, this seems to be the *only* argument many people care to make. It's all "freedom, freedom, freedom!" (and it's all white people but that's a topic for another day), but what these people are asking for, crying for, demanding even, isn't freedom at all! If these people actually got what they want, they'd find themselves with no freedoms, period. We seem to have lost all concept of "freedom" and now conflate it with everyone's innate ability to act and speak.

"I'm free to do what I want" is a true statement, but it is not freedom. We are all human. We can all talk. We can all participate in society. There is nothing that physically restrains us from saying or doing whatever we want. We are also free to suffer the consequences of our actions. If you curse at someone, don't be surprised if that person is less interested in talking to you, or curses you back. If you punch someone, don't be surprised if you get punched back. If you publicly support a hate-filled political regime, don't be surprised if [people no longer want to buy your product](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/latinos-boycotting-goya-say-it-s-not-about-politics-it-n1234052). If you party with hundreds of others during a pandemic, you shouldn't be surprised when you [end up positive for COVID-19](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/07/10/several-test-positive-virus-after-torch-lake-july-4-celebration/5418980002/). But this truth is lost on many today, for many reasons that I'll get into in another article. For today, we will focused on the concept of "freedom."

Webster defines ["freedom"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freedom) as "the quality or state of being free: such as the absence of necessity, coercion, or constraint in choice or action." It's easy to focus on a surface-level understanding of this definition, e.g. "you can't tell me what I can and cannot do" but spend time thinking about what it really takes to create a functional society in which all members are truly free, then a lot of nuance and questions start to show. Most importantly, one eventually ends up at the question: "What happens if someone does something that makes it difficult or impossible for me to exercise my freedom?" and we suddenly understand why "freedom" is such a difficult topic to discuss. What happens if someone steals my money and I'm no longer free to buy what I want? What happens if someone steals my *life*?

A society with no rules whatsoever has a specific term: anarchy, and ironically, anyone striving for "pure freedom" will end up here and find that they've lost all of the freedoms they ever had. In a society with no rules there is no freedom because every moment must be spent worrying about and protecting yourself against what others may do to you. Your actions are now *completely* dictated by others, and vis-versa. Thus, where there is anarchy there by definition cannot be freedom.

So rules, and more importantly rules that all in the society agree on, are *required* for there to be freedom, but even that doesn't fully explain "freedom". If people spend their days questioning if their actions are infringing on a societal rule or law, then their every action is dictated by those laws and that doesn't sound much like freedom either! Did we just talk ourselves into a circle and start right back where we began? Well, no, but to understand why requires looking at "freedom" from a different angle.

You may have noticed that this article is included in my [Christianity]({{< relref "series/christianity" >}}) series of articles and that's because, at its core, Christianity is about freedom, true freedom. Humanity became [enslaved to sin]({{< relref "articles/evil-and-sin" >}}) the moment we first disobeyed God, and there nothing we can do to save ourselves from death and Hell. But our Creator loved us so much that he became human, served, taught, and died, giving up His freedom and experiencing the punishment meant for us. In doing so, He freed us from our own sinful nature. God, through Christ, gave us our freedom by giving up His.

And that's the key. Freedom is a gift *we give to others*, it is *not* something we take for ourselves. Only when we are looking out for each other can there ever be true freedom. Can we ever attain true freedom here on Earth? Probably not, but we can and should constantly strive to provide this gift to as many people as possible. We will and do make mistakes. We will and do impinge and obstruct the freedom of others (Black Lives Matter!). But if we acknowledge our failings, forgive others when they fail, and *try to do better*, only then will we make any meaningful progress towards true freedom.

Here are some thoughts and things we can do today that will improve our society

* Black Lives Matter. If you don't understand this yet, watch [Race in America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGUwcs9qJXY)
* Wear a mask! If everyone wore a mask we would have this pandemic under control in less than a month. [Masks work](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6928e2.htm).
* Treat each other with dignity and respect, even when you disagree. This is especially true when discussing politics.
