In 2016, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States of America, buoyed strongly by Evangelical Christians, who overwhelmingly voted for him. Many journalists spent a lot of time in the South following the election to understand how this happened. One journalist, in an article that I unfortunately cannot find now, got similar answers from many different pasters: with a Republican president, they no longer had to worry about fighting the "abortion" and "gay" fights and could get back to witnessing.

It was when I read the conclusion to that article that I realized just how serious of a situation we are now in, and how big of a hole one would need to fill to be able to properly talk about Christianity. If I was going to say anything, I would need to back it up with Biblical sources and a strong foundation of what Christianity actually is, because a Twitter argument or a single article simply would have been wasted effort and ignored. So, January of 2017 I published the first article of what has turned into an 11 part series about [Christianity]({{< relref "series/christianity" >}}), what it is, what it isn't, and what it means to be a Christian in today's world across many different topics.

As we close in on election day 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and an ever-nastier re-election campaign from President Trump, it's time to go back to the original question that started this all: Why and how did self-proclaimed Christians choose Trump?

Now, given the title of this article, one may think that this discussion is about politics, so before we dive in I want to be explicitly clear about what I'm writing about today:

* This article is not about politics.
* This article is not about the Republican Party.
* This article is not about the Democrat Party.
* This article is definitely not about Donald Trump.
* This article is not about the 2016 election.
* This article *is* about something infinitely more important than all of the above.

To clarify one of the points, I know a few people who voted for Trump in 2016 for reasons outside of "he is the Republican candidate" and I understand and respect those choices. Every one of those people would never, ever vote for him again, and this article isn't about those people or anyone else in that situation. 2016 was a difficult year for many reasons. What I'm talking about today has existed for far longer than a single election cycle.

Lets put ourselves in the shoes of a non-Christian and compare two scenarios. On one hand, we have a man who is a publicly professed Christian, who is faithful to his wife, empowers his wife to be successful on her own merits, and genuinely tries to serve the people he is put in charge of. This person is attacked mercilessly by self-proclaimed Christians who proclaim that the end times are upon us and even call him the Anti-Christ. On the other hand we have a man who is publicly professed non-religious, has had multiple wives, every one of which he has cheated on, demands loyalty but gives none in return and demands that everything good is because of him. This person is praised by the same self-proclaimed Christians, God is praised for his existence, and some even claim that he is the second coming of Christ.

What is a non-Christian supposed to make of this situation? I speak of course of Barrack Obama and Donald Trump, respectively. Obama was ruthlessly attacked by Christians for the entirety of his eight years as president. Evangelical leaders like Dr James Dobson went as far as writing a 16-page "letter from the future" offering over 30 predictions of how this country was going to end because we elected Obama to the Presidency (in not a single one of the predictions came true). And then in 2016 we had these exact same Christians literally fawning themselves all over Trump, praising him for "saving" America and proclaiming him the best thing since Christ, viciously attacking anyone who would question such a stance, or bring up the (now) tens of thousands of ways that Trump shouldn't have Christian support.

Seriously, what is a non-Christian supposed to make of America right now? There is only one answer, and had I not been brought up in a household and family that taught actual Christian values, I'd be right there with them: "No thanks, I would rather not associate myself with such hypocrites."

Now, as I cover in [Christianity]({{< relref "articles/christianity" >}}), [A Christian]({{< relref "articles/a-christian" >}}), and [Evil and Sin]({{< relref "articles/evil-and-sin" >}}), life on this Earth and life as a Christian is going to contain some hypocrisy. It is impossible for us to fully live like Christ taught us, but we are supposed to try, and try hard. This is a fundamental aspect of our witness as Christians, that we are fallen but Christ forgives us, and the enormity of the gift He gave us is supposed to drive us to provide the same to others. What we see today though, seems to be Christians either revelling in this hypocrisy, or simply being completely ignorant as to how far from Christ they and their actions truly are.

How did we end up here? How have so many self-proclaimed Christians ended up supporting a man, a campaign, and an entire political party that embodies (in Trump, literally) the exact opposite of everything Christ taught? The answer is back at the beginning of this article. The pastors this journalist interviewed were simply grateful that with a Republican in power again, they no longer had to "fight the abortion fight" and could redirect their energy back to witnessing again. But who are they witnessing to? Who is going to look at the blatant hypocrisy of Christians praising Donald Trump and want to be a part of that group? Is it really any wonder why Christianity and religion in general is losing people at an increasing rate in the 21st century? How do we explain this mess? Well, I really only have one way to put it, and as this literally a matter of eternal life or eternal death, I have to be as blunt as possible:

Some decades ago, possibly longer, Christians made a deal with the Devil that the Republican party would be anti-abortion and anti-gay-rights as long as Christians voted for the party *and never questioned anything else the party did.* I will hereby refer to this as The Deal.

At face value, the entire idea sounds preposterous. A Christian dealing with the Devil? However, we must be clear about who the Devil is. The Devil, Satan, or Lucifer was once an angel in God's court, one who was given free will and eventually became prideful and envious of God Himself. This pride led to him being cast out and condemned him to his eventual eternal fate: the lake of fire. Satan knows what awaits him at the end of time so his entire purpose is to bring with him as many humans as he possibly can. As an angel, Satan is immensely intelligent and powerful in his own right, and, known also as the Great Deceiver, can appear as bright, good, and heavenly as they come, and what's a better method of deception than tricking Christians into doing the Devil's work for him? With this, it's easier to see how one can be tricked into thinking you were making a deal with God (ignoring that God doesn't "make deals", he already gave us the best deal we could ever have dreamed of).
