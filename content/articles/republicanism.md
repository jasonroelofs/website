In 2016, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States of America, buoyed strongly the overwhelming support of Evangelical Christians. This has triggered a lot of soul-searching and research into just what happened. I personally was a little in shock, but then I read one journalist's article (which I unfortunately cannot find anymore) I knew I had to do something. This journalist spent months travelling throughout the South, going to churches and talking to a myriad of pastors about politics and Trump. The vast majority of pastors had the same answer: with a Republican president, they no longer had to worry about fighting the "abortion" and "gay rights" fights and could get back to witnessing.

I grew up in a conservative, Republican, military (Air Force) household, though thankfully politics was never discussed much at home so I wasn't really aware of what was going on until I moved into adulthood. From my upbringing though I was well aware of the sentiment that "Christians vote Republican", but as I started to become more aware of politics and world events, that sentiment made less and less sense. I regularly saw situations where Republicans made decidedly anti-Christian choices and were praised for it, while Democrats were attacked for proposing ideas that fit much closer to the Christian world view. It was when I read those journalist's words, that pastors no longer had to spend energy on the "abortion" fight and get back to witnessing, that it all became clear, and I knew I needed to say something.

But how do you say something, and get heard, in a world of Twitter and Facebook, where conversations try to happen in 200 characters or less, or with complete strangers yelling at each other? The noise was already growing to a cacophany and would only get worse. So I couldn't just take to Twitter and throw out some pithy messages, those words would just get lost in the flood. It was time to write something of substance. I would need to start at the beginning, to explain what Christianity actually is, from core principles and Biblical teachings, and work my way through the religion before finally getting into wordly issues and current events. Thus, I started my [Christianity]({{< relref "series/christianity" >}}), and this article is the culmination of that effort. The groundwork is now set, it's time to talk about what is happening to Christianity in this country. Why did Christians overwhelmingly support Donald Trump in 2016, and why is there still so much support for him as we inch closer to Election Day 2020?

Now, given the title of this article, one may think that this discussion is about politics, so before we dive in I want to be explicitly clear about what I'm writing about today:

* This article is not about politics.
* This article is not about the Republican Party.
* This article is not about the Democratic Party.
* This article is not about conservative or liberal views.
* This article is not about the 2016 election.
* This article is definitely not about Donald Trump.
* This article *is* about something infinitely more important than all of the above.

I'd also like to be clear that what I'm talking about today isn't a new issue or even from the past four years, but something I've observed over decades, which is all coming to a culmination in 2020.

Lets put ourselves in the shoes of a non-Christian and compare two scenarios. On one hand, we have a man who is a publicly professed Christian, who is not only faithful to his wife, but empowers his wife to be successful on her own merits, and who genuinely tries to serve the people he is put in charge of. This person is attacked mercilessly by self-proclaimed Christians who proclaim that the end times are upon us, even to the point of some calling him the Anti-Christ. On the other hand we have a man who is publicly professed non-religious, has had multiple wives, every one of which he has cheated on, demands loyalty but gives none in return and demands that everything good is because of him. This person is praised by the same self-proclaimed Christians, God is praised for his existence, and some even claim that he is the second coming of Christ.

What is a non-Christian supposed to make of this? How are Christians hating one of their own and praising someone who exhibits none of Christ's teachings? I speak of course of Barrack Obama and Donald Trump, respectively. Obama was ruthlessly attacked by Christians for the entirety of his eight years as president. Evangelical leaders like Dr James Dobson went as far as writing a 16-page "letter from the future" offering over 30 predictions of how this country was going to end because we elected Obama to the Presidency (not a single one of the predictions came true). And then in 2016 we had these exact same Christians literally fawning themselves all over Trump, praising him for "saving" America and proclaiming him the best thing since Christ, viciously attacking anyone who would question their devotion.

Seriously, what is a non-Christian supposed to make of America right now? There is only one answer, and had I not been brought up in a household and family that taught actual Christian values, I'd be right there with them: "No thanks, I would rather not associate myself with such hypocricy."

Now, as I cover in [Christianity]({{< relref "articles/christianity" >}}), [A Christian]({{< relref "articles/a-christian" >}}), and [Evil and Sin]({{< relref "articles/evil-and-sin" >}}), life on this Earth and life as a Christian is going to contain some hypocrisy. It is impossible for us to fully live like Christ taught us, but we are supposed to try, and try hard. This is supposed to be a fundamental aspect of our witness as Christians, that we are fallen but Christ not only forgives us but died in our place so we can live forever. The enormity of this gift is supposed to drive us to love and serve others as Christ serves us, but, again, we will fail at this, it's inevitable. What we see today though, seems to be Christians are ignorant as to how far from Christ their words and their actions truly are.

How did we end up here? How have so many self-proclaimed Christians ended up supporting a man, a campaign, and an entire political party that embodies (in Trump, literally) the exact opposite of everything Christ teaches? The answer is back at the beginning of this article. The pastors the journalist interviewed were simply grateful that a Republican was in power again. It wasn't about the man, just the party, and now they could "get back to witnessing". But who are these pastors witnessing to? Who is going to look at the blatant hypocrisy of Christians praising Donald Trump (and reviling Barrack Obama) and want to be a part of that group? Is it really any wonder why Christianity and religion in general is losing people at an ever increasing rate here in the 21st century? How do we explain this mess? Well, I really only have one way to put it, and as this literally a matter of eternal life or eternal death, I'm going to be blunt:

Some decades ago, possibly longer, Christians made a deal with the Devil that the Republican party would be anti-abortion (and later, anti-gay-rights) as long as Christians voted for the party *and never questioned anything else the party did.* This then was intended to free up Christians from having to think about difficult political and societal issues.

I'll admit, at face value, the entire idea sounds preposterous. A Christian dealing with the Devil? However, we must be clear about who the Devil is. The Devil, Satan, or Lucifer was once an angel in God's court, one who was given free will and through that eventually became prideful and envious of God Himself. This pride led to him being cast out and condemned to his eventual eternal fate: the lake of fire. Satan knows what awaits him at the end of time so his entire purpose is to bring as many people with him as he possibly can. As a former angel, Satan is immensely intelligent and powerful in his own right, and, known also as the Great Deceiver, can appear as bright, good, and heavenly as they come. What better method of deception than tricking Christians into doing the Devil's job by pretending to be God Himself? It's brilliant and insidious, and in an ironic twist, Donald Trump has now given the game away. With a Republican party platform that is now, literally, [RESOLVED, That the Republican Party has and will continue to enthusiastically support the President’s America-first agenda](https://prod-cdn-static.gop.com/docs/Resolution_Platform_2020.pdf), (in which there is no official agenda, only what comes out of Trump's mouth) the Republican party has fully embraced pure hero worship. The deal is complete. There is no Christ in this party anymore, there is only Trump.
