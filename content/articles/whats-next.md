> Mercy without justice is the mother of dissolution; [and] justice without mercy is cruelty
> - Thomas Acquinas

I've been writing software both professionally and as a hobby for about twenty years now, and I have to be honest, I can't just keep doing the same thing for the next twenty years. Having just come off a stint of four years at [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com) and previously having had the fortune to experience how things work inside of places like Apple and Netflix as a contractor, I don't like what I see.

Software has stagnated.

The truth is, while companies are out there solving real problems for real people, internally these companies are powered by millions of software developers building the exact same systems and tooling in slightly different ways. Everyone needs logging, metrics, data platforms, online and offline processing, streaming, etc, and either these teams are buying existing, building their own, both, or splitting out new companies to solve these problems in slightly different ways as other competitors. And underneath it all, these tools and services are powered by the same languages, tooling, and technology, with the same problems, the same limitations, and the same frustrations.

It doesn't matter if we're developing in Ruby, Python, Javascript, Java, C++, or any of the other myriad of options, software hasn't substantially changed for decades, and that has been bugging me to no end for the past few years. To put it in a more abstract sense, we as an industry have failed to make computing and computability available to all. We walk around with computational power that rivals the supercomputers of past, yet we have no ability to use that computability for our own purposes outside of what has been provided for us (or, as software developers, that we have provided for people).

Maybe the best way to explain the point I'm trying to make is: what singular piece of software is the most powerful, most successful, and pivotal for the successful functioning of every single corporation?

The spreadsheet.

No-one talks about how the spreadsheet is a computation platform, but that's exactly what was invented in [1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc). Whether it's Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, nothing has exposed the computational capabilities of computers to the masses than the spreadsheet, and that is still the case 45(!) years later. Everyone, from basic accounting to inventory tracking to weather reporting to biological research (who had to [change their own naming convention because of a feature in Excel that Microsoft refused to change](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355674/human-genes-rename-microsoft-excel-misreading-dates)), uses spreadsheets. Conceptually they are immensely powerful for one simple fact: they start with the data first. That isn't to say spreadsheets are perfect, it's very easy to end up with an unmaintainable mess because the logic that runs them ends up hidden and difficult to keep track of.

Now, I've written multiple versions of this article, all previously with the goal of trying to figure out what we should even be trying. What does "developing software" look like in the year 2030? 2040? 2050? How do we make computability more accessible and available to more people? Or to put it another way, what is the next big revolution of software and in software and computers in general? More personally, how do I want to develop software?

None of these previous versions got published because, in the end, I've been asking the wrong question. We as a tech industry and community have a far greater problem in front of us:

Software sucks.

It is *extrodinarily* rare to encounter software that just works, doesn't crash, doesn't break in weird ways, and that you can use and forget about. My off-the-top-of-my-head list of software that hasn't made me go "WTF?" is: [vim](), [redis]()
