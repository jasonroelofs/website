I started this trilogy of articles by talking about the beginning of life and abortion in [Life, Part 1]({{< relref "articles/life-part-1" >}}). The second part, [Life, Part 2]({{< relref "articles/life-part-2" >}}), covered the end of life and guns. In part three, I'd like to talk about what's in the middle, health care.

As a heads up, I didn't originally intend for this article to dive into political matters but reality has kind of forced my hand. I'm writing this in March and April of 2020 as the Coronavirus epidemic is growing exponentially here in the US. While this virus doesn't change what I intend to say here, it definitely adds a particular ugency that we learn the right lessons now so that a disaster of this magnitude never happens again.

Jesus, during his stay on Earth, made it very clear that healing the sick was a major aspect of his ministry. Of the many miracles recorded in the gospels, the majority are some form of healing of those who are sick or otherwise afflicted. He not only [healed](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+4.43-54&version=NIV) [many](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+8%3A16-17&version=NIV) [people](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+1.40-45&version=NIV) [of](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+9.1-8&version=NIV) [various](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+8.42-48&version=NIV) [ailments](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+7.1-10&version=NIV) but He also raised people from the dead, including [Jairus's daughter](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+8.40-56&version=NIV) and most famously, [Lazarus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+11&version=NIV).

The message is pretty clear and consistent: Christians are called on, in no uncertain terms, to take care of the sick, the suffering, and anyone who is otherwise unwell.

So it beggars belief that Christians across this country work so hard, and so tirelessly, to not only prevent, but to take away, access to health care from those who need it most! But I'm getting a little ahead of myself. Like the previous articles, lets break this down from the beginning.

In many ways it can be said that today's understanding of health and medicine is a modern miracle. Because it is so hard to see and understand the small aspects of life, for thousands of years it was widely believed that most illnesses were due to "bad air" or [miasmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory). And even though we've had forms of microscopes for hundreds of years, it took all the way until the mid 1800s for us to realize and accept that micro-organisms like bacteria and virii are responsible for most illnesses. Then through the US Civil War, two World Wars, and events like the 1918 flu epidemic, we learned a ton about how germs work, how they spread, and how to treat them, such that modern times boast the longest average lifespan of known human history. It can be hard for us to grasp, but for the vast majority of human history, diseases we now consider routine and treatable (e.g. the bubonic plague) were deadly and unstoppable disasters.
